# Portfolio Landing-Page

## About
As a viable computer coder I want to show employers that I know how to make react applications. This is a sample of both my personal style and my past work history and project experiences.
By making this react portfolio employers can assess wheather my methodology of coding and design would be a good fit for their business.
